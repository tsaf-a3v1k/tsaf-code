# Red Blood Cell Demand Forecasting

**Welcome to the official repository for the Red Blood Cell (RBC) Demand Forecasting project.** This project employs advanced time-series modeling techniques, including SARIMA, to predict RBC demand over the next 12 months. By hosting this repository on GitHub Pages, we aim to share insights, visualizations, and methodologies for healthcare resource optimization.
